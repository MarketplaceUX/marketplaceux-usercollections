# User Collections Design Spec

OVERVIEW

Allow Marketplace community members to create collections of apps for themselves, to share with friends and family and to share with the Marketplace community.

USER PROBLEM

User collectionsâ€¦

Why users want to consume collections
* People want help finding great apps that are relevant to their interests and locale. Collections highlight the best apps. 

Why users want to create collections
* People want to be able to save apps for later. They might be on data and want to save an app to download later when they have a wifi connection. Or a user might be deciding between many different types of apps and wants to bookmark them and review them before selecting one and downloading it.
* People want to help their friends find cool apps. 
* People want to share their expertise of apps with others. 

BUSINESS PROBLEM
What business problems do collections solve
* Firefox Marketplace will always have a limited paid editorial staff. We need community members to create compelling content for Marketplace users to consume
* Firefox Marketplace needs to show locally relevant content. We need community members in each region to create locally relevant content for users to consume. 

TARGET AUDIENCE
Collections have different audiences based 
Everyone/Majority of users
* Consuming collections
* App wish lists
Power users
* Creating new lists
* Sharing with friends & family
* Making list public
